### Introduction
I am coming from a nature science background and therefore decided on trying to use
machine learning on meteorological data. More explicitly I will try to use the model output of one 
of the german weather models and cluster the weather conditions location-wise over the northern part
of germany. I will then use the Foursquare location data to examine where to a given location is the
next coffee shop with better weather conditions. I will not use real positional data, but rather 
an example position which will be hardcoded in the program.

This is all just a proof of concept, but in a real world scenario lots of stakeholders could be
interested in such an application. Actually any rating service, such as yelp or tripadvisor 
could use such data to not only provide the best coffee shop close to you, but to further provide
the one with the best actual weather conditions.
